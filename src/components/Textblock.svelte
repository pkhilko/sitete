We felt this pain at Google, so we started Project IDX, an experimental new initiative aimed at bringing your entire full-stack, multiplatform app development workflow to the cloud. Project IDX starts with a web-based workspace that'll feel familiar for coding but fresh. And we're just at the beginning of this journey. We'd love your input as we work to make application development better.";
